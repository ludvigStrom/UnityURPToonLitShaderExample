This repository does NOT contain the full version of NiloToonURP.  
Instead, it includes a simple, short and easy-to-read URP toon shader example for Unity2022.3LTS, which is intended for shader coding tutorial purposes. The shader example is licensed under the MIT license, giving you the freedom to use the code as you wish. If you'd like to retain the current tutorial shader, we recommend forking it or downloading a copy now, as it may be removed in the future.
